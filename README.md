# Gesture-Recognition-Software
The prototype uses a camera, Raspberry PI 4, and Python script to count the number of fingers displayed in a region of the camera to perform functions for a media file (i.e., Play song).
* CS-530: Systems Programming with Ben Shen (Fall 2021)
* Forked from https://github.com/gnuyent/cs530-project
* Youtube video gives a brief demonstration of what the prototype is capable of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tova3CfmcgU

## What I learned
* First experience with Python.
* Implemented active camera that is actively being converted into grayscale and binary images.
* Thresholding binary images.
* Smoothing and Blurring images.
* Applied Noise reduction to camera feed.
* Detect Contour points, lines, and defects in the binary images.
